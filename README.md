## DocsPen

**DocsPen** is a hub to publish your own documentation for projects through online, it is a right choice for Professors & Teachers for publishing the content, which provides a pleasant and simple out of the box experience. New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive and only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating content on DocsPen. The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it but they should not interfere with the core simple user experience.

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep `DocsPen` open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DocsPen/DocsPen/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Translations

As part of DocsPen v1.0.0-beta support for translations has been built in. All text strings can be found in the `resources/lang` folder where each language option has its own folder. To add a new language you should copy the `en` folder to an new folder (eg. `fr` for french) then go through and translate all text strings in those files, leaving the keys and file-names intact. If a language string is missing then the `en` translation will be used. To show the language option in the user preferences language drop-down you will need to add your language to the options found at the bottom of the `resources/lang/en/settings.php` file. A system-wide language can also be set in the `.env` file like so: `APP_LANG=en`.

You will also need to add the language to the `locales` array in the `config/app.php` file.

There is a script available which compares translation content to `en` files to see what items are missing or redundant. This can be ran like so from your DocsPen install folder:

```bash
# Syntax
php resources/lang/check.php <lang>

# Examples
php resources/lang/check.php fr
php resources/lang/check.php pt_BR
```

Some strings have colon-prefixed variables in such as `:userName`. Leave these values as they are as they will be replaced at run-time.
